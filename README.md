# google-workspace apps-scripts

A collection of [Google Workspace apps scripts](https://www.google.com/script/start/) that I use a lot or have found useful.  As an administrator for Google Workspace the admin portal is annoyingly limited.  There is more control with enterprise license versions, but even then it's often useful to use other tools to assist in automation or bulk updates. 

A popular (SysAdmin) approach is it use the [GAM CLI tool](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM) but I find (as a former software engineer) that code within the Google Apps Script environment is preferable.
