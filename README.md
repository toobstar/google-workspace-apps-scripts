# google-workspace-apps-scripts

A collection of [Google Workspace apps scripts](https://www.google.com/script/start/) that I use a lot or have found useful.  As an administrator for Google Workspace the admin portal is extremely limited.  Some people may prefer a [CLI approach](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM) but I find (hosted) code to be best.
